    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my most requested party recipe. People go crazy for these meatballs, and there is never a single one leftover at the end of a party or tailgate. The best part (aside from them being delicious) is that they are sooo easy to make!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg frozen cooked Meatbals</li>
        <li>1 can of whole berry Cranberry Juice</li>
        <li>1 bottle tomato-based Chili Sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 of a Lemon</li>
        <li>2 drops of hot sauce (such as Tabasco) or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place frozen meatballs into a slow cooker. Add cranberry sauce, chili sauce, lemon juice, and hot sauce. Stir to distribute sauce evenly over meatballs.</li>
        <li>Cook on High until meatballs are completely thawed and hot, about 3 hours.</li>
    </ol>
