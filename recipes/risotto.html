    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large head of broccoli</li>
        <li>300g of medium grain rice</li>
        <li>1.5L of chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>50g anchovies</li>
        <li>100g of Parmesan / Gorgonzola cheese</li>

        <li>Bring the stock to a simmer in a large pot.</li>
        <li>Slice up the onion and the stalk of the brocolli, cutting the florets into smaller pieces.</li>

        <li>Using a ladle, scoop a ladleful of stock and spread it around the rice, stirring to mix. Let it cook for a couple of minutes until the rice has absorbed the stock, then repeat adding ladles of stock.</li>
        <li>When you've used around half of the stock, add in the broccoli florets and stir them into the rice.</li>
        <li>When you have only a few ladelfuls of stock left, shred the cheese and sprinkle it into the rice. Then add the last of the stock.</li>
        <li>After the last of the stock has been absorbed, turn the heat off and leave it to sit for 2 miunutes, then serve.</li>
